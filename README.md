# Overview

I love the original NES Legend of Zelda, and I've tried writing it in [Unity](https://github.com/incutonez/ZeldaU), but I had gotten a little burned out from doing that, so I decided to try something like it in TypeScript + Vue + Phaser 3.

# Deployed Version

You can view the deployed version [here](https://incutonez.github.io/fable-basin/).  It's deployed using [GitHub Pages Deploy Action](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action).

# Architecture

The individual screens are stored in JSON and generated using my [LoJ World Builder app](http://incutonez.github.io/Sandbox/#/game).

# Assets

The assets were taken from various areas, and I've tried to generalize colors on the models, so their colors can be changed dynamically.
